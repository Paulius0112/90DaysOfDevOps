# 90DaysOfDevOps

Hello! My name is Paulius and currently I am working as a **DevOps** engineer. However, decided to take a **90 Days of DevOps** challenge and document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of DevOps. I will be starting this journey on the 20st March 2022.

The goal is to take 90 days, a few hours a day to enhance my skills in various DevOps areas.

This journey will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and experience various technologies in DevOps.
