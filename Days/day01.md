# EC2

- Is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.
- *Pricing Models*
    - You pay as you go and for what you use, pay less as you use more, 
    - **On Demand** - allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment. Great for development
        - Is useful when wanting a low cost and flexibility of EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
        - Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
        - Applications being developed or tested on EC2 for the first time
    - **Reserver** - provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. Contract Terms are 1 year or 3 year terms. The more you pay upfront, the more you are going to save
        - Application with steady state or predictable usage
        - Applications that require reserved capacity
        - Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further 
        - **Reserve Pricing Types**
            - Standard Reserver instances - offer up to 75% off demand instances. The more you pay up front and the longer the contract, the greater the discount (Cannot be moved across regions)
            - Convertible Reserver instances - offer up to 54% off on demand capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of Reserver Instances of equal or greater value
            - Scheduled Reserver instances - are available to launch within the time windows you reserve. It allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, week, month
        - __Reserved Instances that are terminated__ are **still billed** until the end of their term according to their payment option.
        - *Note* - if it is scheduled to run only a short period, it might not be efficient to use reserved instances, because you need to pay for the whole year
    - **Spot** - enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end time. You state the price, once price is meet, instance is created. If price increases, the instance will be removed.
        - Application that are only feasible at very low computing prices
        - Applications that have flexible start and end time.
        - Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity
        - *Note*. If the spot instace is terminated by EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage. However, if you terminat the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran
    - **Dedicated Hosts** - physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses
        - Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
        - Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
        - Can be purchased On-Demand (hourly)
        - Can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off the On-Demand price
        - With __EC2 dedicated hosts__ we have control over __number of cores__, not anywhere else.

__Security groups__
- All Inbound traffic is blocked by default
- All Outbound traffic is allowed
- Changes to Security groups take immediately
- You can have multiple EC2 on the same security group and vice versa
- Security groups are stateful - if you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic automatically allowed as outbound
- You cannot block specific IP using security groups, only Network Access Control List
- You can only specify allow rules, not deny

__AMI__
Can be selected on
- Region
- OS
- Architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
- Launch Permissions
- Storage for the Root device
    1. Instance Store (Emhemeral storage) - cannot be stopped. If underlying host fails, you will lose your data
    2. EBS backed volumes - can be stopped. Will not lose your data if instace is stopped
- By default both ROOT volumes will be deleted on EC2 termination. However, with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume
- You can't delete a snapshot of the root device of an EBS volume used by a registered AMI. You must first deregister the AMI before you can delete the snapshot.


__ENI, ENA, EFA__
- *ENI - elastic network interface* - essentially a virtual network card. Choose for basic networking, or manage multiple networks at low cost
    1. Primary private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC
    2. One or more secondary private IPv4 addresses from the IPv4 address range of your VPC
    3. One Elastic IP address (IPv4) per private IPv4 address
    4. One public IPv4 address
    5. One or more IPv6 addresses
    6. One or more security groups
    7. A mac address
    8. A source/destination check flag
    9. Description
- You can attach a network interface (ENI) to an EC2 instance in the following ways â€”
    1. When it's running. Hot attach.
    2. When it's stopped. Warm attach.
    3. When the instance is being launched. Cold attach.
- *EN - Enhanced networking*. Uses single root I/O virtualization to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported instance types
    1. Provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization when compared to traditional virtualised network interface. Provides higher bandwidth, packet per second performance and lower inter-instance latencies. There is no additional charge for using enhanced networking, but EC2 must support it.
    2. To use where you want good network performance
    3. Can be enabled using:
        - *Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)* which supports network speeds of up to 100Gbps for supported instance types. Always choose this method
        - *Virtual Function (VF)* interface - suports network speeds of up to 10Gbps for supported instance types. This is typically used on older instances. 
    4. Choose for when you need speeds between 10Gbps and 100Gbps and reliable and high throughput.
    
- *Elastic Fabric Adapter* - a network device that you can attach to your EC2 instance to accelerate High Performance Computing and ML applications
    1. Choose for when you need to accelerate High Performance Comouting (HPC) and ML applications or if you need to do an OS by-pass. 

__SPOT instances and fleets__
- Use unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud. Are available at up to 90% discount comparaed to On-Demand. Can use for stateless, fault-tolerant or flexiable applications, such as big data, containeriz workloads, CI/CD, web servers, HPC and other test workloads. They are not good for persistent workloads, critical jobs and databases
- To use the Spot Instances, you must first decide on your maximum Spot price. The instance will be provisioned so long as the Spot price is below your maximum Spot price. Hourly spot price varies depending on capacity and region
- If spot price goes above your maximum, you have two minutes to choose wheter to stop or terminate your instance
- You can use *Spot block* to stop your Spot Instances from being terminated even if the Spot price goes over your maximum Spot price. You can set Spot blocks for between one to six hours currently. 
- *Procces of creating a spot instance*
    1. Create a request (Maximum price, Desired amount of instances, Launch specifications, Request type (one time or persistent), Timeline (Valid from and valid until))
    2. Launch the instance. If the price increases, one time instances will be removed, while persistent will be removed and launched again once th eprice meets the criteria 

__Spot fleets__
- Is a collection of Spot Instances and optionally, On-Demand instances.
- The spot fleet attempts to maintain its target capacity fleet if your spot instances are interupted.
- Tasks done:
    1. Set up different launch pools. Define things like EC2 instance type, OS and AZ
    2. You can have multiple pools, and the fleet will choose the best way to implement depending on the strategy youd define. Strategies:
        - *capacityOptimized* - The spot instances come from the pool with optimal capacity for the number of instances launching
        - *diversified* - The spot instaces are distributed across all pools
        - *lowerPrice* - the spot instances come from the pool with the lowest price. This is the default strategy
        - *InstancePoolsToUseCount* - the spot instaces are distributed across the number of spot instance pool ypu specify. This parameter is valid only when used in combination with lowestPrice
    3. Spot fleets will stop launching instances once you reach your price threshold or capacity desire

__EC2 Hipernate__
- When you hibernate an EC2 instance, the OS is told to perform hibernation. It saves the contents from the instance memory RAM to your EBS root volume.
- OS does not need to reboot, since the RAM contents are reloaded, rovides much faster boot up
- It requires to have root volume encryption
- Instance RAM must be less than 150 GB
- Can't be hibernated for more than 60 days

__Cloudtrail__
- increases visibility into your user and resource activity by recording AWS Management COnsole actions and API calls

__Cloudwatch__
- Can monitor most of AWS as well as your applications that run on AWS
- CloudWatch with EC2 will monitor events every 5 minutes by default
- You can have 1 miunte intervals by turning on detailed monitoring

__IAM Roles__
- Roles are more secure than storing your access and secret keys on individual EC2 instances.
- Roles are easier to manage
- Roles can be assigned to EC2 instances after it is created using both console and command line
- Roles are universal - can be used in any region


__EC2 placement groups__
- When you launch a new EC2 instance, the EC2 service **attempts to place the instance in such a way that all of your instances are spread out across underlying hardware to minimize correlated failures.**
- The name for placement group must be **unique** within your AWS account
- You cant merge placement groups
- You can move existing instance into a placement group. Before you can move the instance, the instsance must be stopped. It *can only be achieved using AWS CLI or SDK*, not yet with a console
1. *Clustered Placement group*
    - Grouping instances within a **single AZ** (put them very close together)
    - Recommented for applications that need **low network latency, high network throughput, or both**
    - Only **certain instances** can be launched in this group
    - Can't span multiple AZ, all other groups can
    - AWS recommneds **homogenous instances** within clustered placement group
2. *Spread Placement group*
    - Each instance is placed on **distinct** underlying hardware
    - Recommended for applications that have a small number of **critical instances that should be kept separate from each other**
        - For example if one applications fails, it should not effect the others
    - Can have in **different AZ within a region**
    - Think like separate instances
3. *Partitioned*
    - AWS divides each group into **logical segments called partitions.**
    - Each partition within a placement group has its own **set of racks**. Each eack has its **own network and power source.**
    - No two partitions within a placement group share the same racks, allowing you to **isolate** the impact of hardware failure within your application
    - Think like multiple instances

__High performance computing (HPC)__
- Create a large number of resources in almost no time. You only pay for the resources you use - and, once finished, you can destroy them
- Can be achieved by these services
1. Data transfer (get data into AWS)
    - *Snowball, SNowmobile* (terabytes/petabytes worth of data)
    - *AWS DataSync* to store on S3, EFS, FSx for Windows
    - *Direct Connect* (cloud service that established a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS.)
2. Compute and networking
    - CPU or GPU optimized
    - EC2 fleets (Spot instances or fleets)
    - Placement groups (cluster placement groups)
    - Enhanced networking
        1. Uses single root I/O  (SR-IOV)virtualization to provide high-performance networking on supported instance tpypes. Provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization.
        2. Use where you want good network connection
        3. Provies higher bandwidth, higher packet per second performance, consistently lower inter-instance latencies. There is additional charge for this service
        4. Can be enabled using:
            - *Elastic Network Adapter* - supports network speed of up to 100Gbps (Chose during exam)
            - *Virtual Function* interface, supports network speed up to 10 Gbps used for legacy systems
    - Elastic Network Adapters
    - Elastic Fabric Adapters
        1. Is a network device you can attach to your EC2 to accelerate HPC and ML applications
        2. Provides lower, more consistent latency and higher throughput than the TCP protocol.
        3. Can us OS-bypass, allows HPC and ML applications to bypass OS kernel and communicate directly with the EFA device. Only linux
3. Storage
    1. Instance-attached storage
        - EBS
        - Instance Store - scale to millions of IOPS, low latency
    2. Network storage
        - S3
        - EFS
        - FSx
